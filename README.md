## 📡 API & Data Transparency (Educational Purpose)
This project was built to demonstrate web scraping, data structuring, and frontend UI design as part of a **cybersecurity and software development portfolio**. 
- Data is extracted systematically using custom Node.js scrips (`update_values.js`) to parse DOM elements from community platforms.
- The raw data is then restructured, stored statically in a clean JSON format, and optimized for speed.
- The trading calculator logic introduces a foundation for building **custom supply-and-demand algorithms** on top of existing baseline values, allowing this tool to evolve beyond a simple reflection of third-party data into an independent valuation engine.
